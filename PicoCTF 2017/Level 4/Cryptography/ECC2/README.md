In this challenge we are given some elliptic curve parameters as well as coordinates of one point on it.
Calculating B value is trivial as we have only one unknown. [calculateB.py](calculateB.py)
```
B = y^2-x^3-A*x (mod M)
B=25255205054024371783896605039267101837972419055969636393425590261926131199030
```

Now we need to find such `n` that `P'=nP`. Elliptic curves multiplication is simply the repeated addition of point P.
Unfortunately the addition is rather complicated and we cannot easily compute `n` given the values we have.

I tried to use algorithms from previous challenge (`bsgs` and `discrete_log_lambda`) wiht bounds `(0,400000000000000000000000000000)`, but they work in `O(sqrt(n))`, so it still takes too much time to compute `n`.

Eventually, I found `Pohligâ€“Hellman` algorithm, which allows us to decrease the complexity.

```python
F = GF(93556643250795678718734474880013829509320385402690660619699653921022012489089)
A = 66001598144012865876674115570268990806314506711104521036747533612798434904785
B = 25255205054024371783896605039267101837972419055969636393425590261926131199030
E = EllipticCurve(F,[0,0,0,A,B])
P = E((56027910981442853390816693056740903416379421186644480759538594137486160388926,65533262933617146434438829354623658858649726233622196512439589744498050226926))
Pn = E((61124499720410964164289905006830679547191538609778446060514645905829507254103,2595146854028317060979753545310334521407008629091560515441729386088057610440))
order = E.order()
subresults = []
factors = []
for prime, exponent in factor(order):
	_factor = prime ** exponent
	factors.append(_factor)
	P2 = P*(order//_factor)
	Pn2 = Pn*(order//_factor)
	subresults.append(discrete_log_lambda(Pn2, P2, (0,_factor), '+'))
print(crt(subresults,factors))
```
(I used `Pollard's lambda` instead of `Baby-step giant-step` mentioned on wikipedia, because it uses less memory)

Unfortunately factors of the order are still too big and we can't find discrete logarithm even for them. (the largest one is `1975901744727669147699767`)

However, we haven't use the fact that `n < 400000000000000000000000000000` yet.

If we stop the algorithm when prime factors get too large (let's say one billion), we can see that the result is `152977126447386808276536247114` (which of course doesn't have to be the correct answer).
However, it's almost 1/2 of the upper boundary for `n`. We can add the modulus to it as long as `n` is less than the upper boundary (it shouldn't take too long).
In my case modulus was already greater than the upper boundary, so I didn't have to add anything.

[solve.sage](solve.sage)

The flag is `152977126447386808276536247114`.
