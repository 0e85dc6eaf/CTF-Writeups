# Leaf of the Tree

> We found this annoyingly named directory tree starting at /problems/8ca1c927e4aedb1db7961d774fa56bcd. It would be pretty lame to type out all of those directory names but maybe there is something in there worth finding? And maybe we dont need to type out all those names...? Follow the trunk, using cat and ls!

Hints:

> Tab completion is a wonderful, wonderful thing

Let's enter /problems/8ca1c927e4aedb1db7961d774fa56bcd directory first.
Then simply type `cd t` and then press tab. Repeat the process as long as tab completion works. When you finish you are in the right directory.
