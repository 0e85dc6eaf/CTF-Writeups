# TW_GR_E2_EoTDS

> Given the relative success of the first release, it was no surprise that a second installment in the TW:GR series was released. I can't beat this one either, though... those darn spatulas put an induction cooktop in the floor so I can't get to the flag! Can you get it for me? You can play the game here.

Hints:

> Toasters can't go through induction cooktops because they're made of metal. However, it looks like there's a nice, friendly spatula on the last floor; and better yet, he's made of rubber! I'm sure he could be persuaded to go pick up the flag and bring it back to you.

This one is actually pretty hard, because we can't hack it ;) What we need to do is to move in that way to force spatula to take the flag and then kill it. It seems there aren't any workarounds for it.
When I attempted to solve this challenge for the first time I was lucky and got my flag immediately. However when I tried to repeat this for my write-up it took me more than hour to finally get it. So keep trying. The only hint i can give is that you can go diagonally on corners.

The flag is `i_dont_want_to_say_goodbye__gets_me_every_time_4ea52e1f6e60b37e759a8134d66bd295`.
