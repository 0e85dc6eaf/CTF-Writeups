# Mystery Box

> You've found a mystery machine with a sticky note attached to it! Oh, there's also this picture of the machine you found.

I had that luck that the day I was solving this problem I read the news about enigma and it was very similar to one on the picture.

I found [this website](http://www.practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/enigma-cipher/) which provides enigma simulation.
Unfortunately it didn't match our sticky note, I had no idea where to use this `Umkehrwalze: B` and what are rotor settings. I even wanted to brute force them.
However the default settings (123) were correct and the B letter was useless in this case (on the other website there was field for it).

The flag is `QUITEPUZZLINGINDEED`.
