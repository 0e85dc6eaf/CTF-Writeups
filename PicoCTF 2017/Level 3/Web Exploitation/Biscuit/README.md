> Your friend has a personal website. Fortunately for you, he is a bit of a noob when it comes to hosting a website. Can you find out what he is hiding? Website.

Hints:

> Viewing the source of the website is usually a good start.

In the source we can see 'super private' cookies.sqlite file. But we can also notice that background comes from `private` directory.
Let's check http://shell2017.picoctf.com:30027/private/cookies.sqlite then. We got SQLite database.
We can explore the file on [this website](https://sqliteonline.com/). We can see that it contains columns named `name` and `value` with values `ID` and `F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd`.
And many other data which could only be the cookie. Let's execute the following script in JS console on the http://shell2017.picoctf.com:30027/.
```javascript
document.cookie = 'ID=F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd';
```
Now refresh the page and you'll get the flag.

The flag is `e5cd648b3f7e254fa0c384e6757233f7`.
