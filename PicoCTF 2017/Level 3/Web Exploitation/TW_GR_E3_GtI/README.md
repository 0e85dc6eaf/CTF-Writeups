# TW_GR_E3_GtI

> Many think the third entry in the Toaster Wars: Going Rogue series didn't live up to Explorers due to its simplified gameplay, but I liked the new plot and ensemble cast better. Anyway, this one also has a flag that I can't figure out how to get...

Hints:

> Clearly, you can't get to the flag. But perhaps you don't need to go over to it at all?

One year after the competitions I decided to try this challenge again. During gameplay I realized that many items in the inventory have the same id.
Let's have a look at server/config.js
```js
function createFlag(location) {
	return {
		name: "Flag",
		description: "Gives you the flag.",
		location: location,
		use: 0,
		id: 12,
		sprite: "flag",
		effects: [
			{
				type: "revealFlag"
			}
		]
	};
}
```
The flag id is relatively small (in previous levels it was at least 100). What if we got another item with id 12?
Another interesting functionality is that if we sort our items we assign them new IDs. If we drop an item and there's another item with the same ID in our range we pick both at once.
The idea is to use this bug so we have 13 items in our inventory, then we sort items, so the last one has ID 12. In last level we drop them all and then we pick only the item with ID=12.
To easily get 13 items in the inventory we can simply repeat the following proccess:
1. sort items
2. drop first one
All items now have ID=0. When we manage to get 13 items this way, we just sort them once again and we can freely use them (just make sure not to use item with ID=12)
This way we'll get the flag as well.

The flag is `the_new_feature_where_you_manage_your_own_shelf_in_the_refrigerator_was_an_interesting_addition_3a4b094d798ee2e4fc2aac44cf9a5902`.
