# A Happy Union

> I really need access to website, but I forgot my password and there is no reset. Can you help? I like lite sql :)

Hints:

> A SQL union allows a single query to select values from multiples tables.

When we create an account with some invalid SQL as login we can see how the query looks like.
The password is probably in users table. Let's use the following code as login:
`' and 0 union select id,user,pass from users where ''='`. After registering log in using this account. You should see your flag in the value column.

The flag is `flag{union?_why_not_onion_513b106578792f5ef8053943cdde00d2}`.
