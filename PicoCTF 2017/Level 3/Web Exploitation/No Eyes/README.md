I wrote small [PHP script](index.php) which gets the flag for us. Execution takes a few minutes, but you you can optimize it by decreasing number of characters or initializing the $brute variable (or using binary search).
Also please notice that `_` is a wildcard so it's better to place it in the end otherwise you'll get something like that
`_______________________________________________________________`. 
For the best result you can initialize $brute variable with `not_all_errors_should_be_shown_` and $chars can now contain only hex digits (a-f0-9).

```
>php index.php
(a lot of output...)
not_all_errors_should_be_shown_fb83c582ee9b64d1f446cfd01702e7c5
```

The flag is `not_all_errors_should_be_shown_fb83c582ee9b64d1f446cfd01702e7c5`.
