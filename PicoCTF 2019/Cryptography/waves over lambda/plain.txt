we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink, and then i understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea.  i must acknowledge i had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.
