You've been given a dataset of 4800 internet traffic logs for your
organization's website. This dataset covers the number of unique IP addresses
sending requests to the site in 15-minute "buckets", across a 24-hour day.
The attached plot will help you see the daily pattern of traffic. You should
see 3 spikes of traffic: one in the morning, one at midday, and one in the
evening.

Your organization needs your help to figure out whether some recent activity
indicates unusual behavior. It looks like some logs have higher-than-usual
traffic in their time bucket: many more unique IP addresses are trying to
access the site than usual. This might be evidence that someone is trying to
do something shady on your site.
