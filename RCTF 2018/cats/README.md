# cats

Our goal in this challenge is to find 15 linux commands that if executed with parameter `food` print the same content as `cat`.
To do this we just tried many commands and we succeeded. It was really helpful to change file content to `food`, so commands that print filename worked too.
The commands we found are:
```
dir,fmt,fold,iconv,printf,paste,echo,sort,find,ls,basename,more,tail,head,php
```

Response:
```
Wew, you've found 15 cats! Here is your flag: RCTF{you_love_cats_dont_you}. If you can find at least 4 out of 5 cats whose names in (python3, bash, php, node, ruby), I will give you another flag ._.
```

Flag: `RCTF{you_love_cats_dont_you}`
