# Warm up 

> Must-Have Pre-Workout Warm up Challenge.

In this challenge we got C source file. When we try to compile it we get some errors. Fortunately they are easy to fix and the program compiles without further problems.
When we run it, it freezes for a moment (or even a bit longer), but in the end it just prints the flag.

```
$ ./warmup
ASIS{hi_all_w31c0m3_to_ASISCTF}
```

Flag: `ASIS{hi_all_w31c0m3_to_ASISCTF}`
