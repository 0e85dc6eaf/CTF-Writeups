# PHP Eval White-List

We were given a shared object with patched eval version, however the challenge was trivial and we didn't even have to download it.
When we typed in `system('../flag');` it just printed us the flag...

Flag: `OOO{Fortunately_php_has_some_rock_solid_defense_in_depth_mecanisms,_so-everything_is_fine.}`
